/**
 * {{ properCase name }} Redux Duck Module
 *
 * A duck is a redux module that contains all of its related constants, actions/action creators, and it’s reducer. 
 * If any of our other modules need access to any of these elements (which will likely be the case in the case of a messaging module), 
 * we’ll export/import what is needed.
